# ðŸš€ Multilingual Speech to Morse Code

This project builds a multilingual speech-to-Morse code converter leveraging OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model fine-tuned on Hindi speech, combined with NLP techniques and translation models. It converts speech and text inputsâ€”especially Hindi audioâ€”into Morse code with options for preprocessing and verification.

## ðŸ§  Model Training and Fine-Tuning

We fine-tuned **OpenAIâ€™s Whisper Small** model on the Hindi subset of the **Mozilla Common Voice 11.0** dataset, containing crowd-sourced spoken audio clips with transcripts, ideal for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).

**Training Setup:**

- Base Model: Whisper Small (transformer-based ASR)
- Framework: Hugging Face Transformers with `Seq2SeqTrainer`
- Batch Size: 16
- Learning Rate: 1e-5
- Training Steps: 4000 (~9â€“10 epochs)
- Mixed precision (fp16) and gradient checkpointing enabled
- Total training time: ~7.3 hours on GPU
- Final training loss: ~0.079

**Deployment:**

- Model saved locally: `./whisper-small-vedant-nlp`
- Hosted on Hugging Face Model Hub:

## ðŸ§© Application Modules

The project features four main interactive modules (tabs):

### ðŸŸ¦ Tab 1: Text to Morse

- Input: Plain text
- Output: Morse code translation using standard key mappings
- Optionally applies NLP preprocessing such as stop word removal with NLTK

### ðŸŸ§ Tab 2: Voice to Morse Code (English)

- Input: English audio recording + user confirmation
- Uses pretrained Whisper Base for speech-to-text transcription
- Optional NLP preprocessing (stop word removal)
- Converts processed text into Morse code

### ðŸŸ¨ Tab 3: Hindi Voice to Morse Code

- Input: Hindi speech audio
- Transcription by fine-tuned Whisper Small model
- Translates Hindi text to English using MarianMT (Helsinki-NLP)
- Converts English translation to Morse code

### ðŸŸ© Tab 4: Verification

- Converts Morse code back to text using reverse mappings
- Verifies accuracy of Morse code translations

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases

- Educational tools to learn Morse code and speech processing
- Accessibility aids for speech-to-text-to-Morse communication
- Emergency or military communication systems
- Cross-lingual speech recognition and translation applications
